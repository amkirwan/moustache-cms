## Getting Started Quickly

- A recent version of MongoDB >= 2.0 installed and running. On Mac OS X you can use [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew) to install Mongodb
- Then clone the repo 
```
git clone git://github.com/amkirwan/moustache-cms.git.
```
- Then from the project root run bundler
```
cd moustache-cms
bundle install 
```
- Next setup the default database from the seed file. This will create a default admin login account with the login email of 'admin@moustachecms.org' and the password set to 'moustache'
```
bundle exec rake db:seed
```
- You can access MoustacheCms now in two ways. If you are using [POW](https://github.com/37signals/pow) create an symlink to moustache-cms and then go to 'http://moustache-cms/admin' to login. If you can also start the Rails server and access the cms via the localhost, then go to 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin to login.
```
bundle exec rails start
````
